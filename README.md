> Markets Trend Direction and Timing of Pivotal Moments for 2024

### What is this repository about?
This repository is deticated to prove the effectiveness of my market timing algorithm.
I intend to use this repository to demostrate the results of my algorithm to investment/trading firms, with the aim of collaborating with them to apply the algorithm on a larger scale in the future.

### How it works?
In short, my market timing algorithm identifies future pivotal moments in the markets - those moments when the price action breaks the trend line, bottoms/tops, makes higher/lower high/low and so on - which can serve as entry/exit points.

Here's the catch: not all moments predicted by the algorithm might turn out to be truly pivotal in the future, and that's alright.

#### Pivotal moments must be supplemented by technical analysis
Timing pivotal moments itself is not enough, when that pivotal moment comes it must be complemented with additional basic technical analysis before entering a position.

For example, when the predicted moment comes and the market looks like testing a support/resistence, or breaking out the trend line, or making a top/bottom and so on, then that moment serves as an entry/exit point. Otherwise, the predicted pivotal moment should be ignored.

## Predictions

### Long- and Mid-Term Opportunities
By analyzing past pivotal moments on higher time scales and the market's subsequent behavior, it is possible to identify the current trend — bullish or bearish — dominating the market. This analysis can guide mid- and long-term investments. Here's the current market condition:

* US10Y - Bearish
* DXY - Bearish
* SPX - Bearish
* NGAS - Bullish
* XAUUSD - Bullish
* BTCUSD - Bearish
* RUBUSD - Bearish
* EURUSD - Bullish
* CNYUSD - Bullish
* GBPUSD - Bullish

It should be noted that the trend of the market might change any time - ranging from a few months to several years.
The market trends mentioned here reflect the current analysis (as of 21.08.2024) and need to be reassessed periodically to adapt to market shifts, so I might update the market condition after a few months if trend change is detected in any of the above-mentioned markets.

### Short-term opportunities

The predicted pivotal moments listed below can be used to make short-term investment decisions, supplemented by additional basic technical analysis.

* US10Y - 12 Sep, 17 Oct
* DXY - 24 Sep, 30 Oct
* SPX - 23 Aug, 16 Oct
* NGAS - 6 Sep, 2 Oct
* CRUDE OIL - 4 Sep, 23 Sep, 28 Oct
* XAUUSD - 26 Sep
* BTCUSD  - 19 Sep, 20 Oct
* RUBUSD - 4 Oct
* EURUSD - 27 Aug, 12 Sep
* CNYUSD - 11 Sep
* GBPUSD - 8 Oct

For now (as of 21.08.2024) I am only giving the pivotal moments until the November of 2024. I will be adding more soon.

Happy Investing!
