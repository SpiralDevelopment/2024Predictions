> Markets Trend Direction and Timing of Pivotal Moments for 2024

### What is this repository about?
This repository is deticated to prove the effectiveness of my market timing algorithm.
I intend to use this repository to demostrate the results of my algorithm to investment/trading firms, with the aim of collaborating with them to apply the algorithm on a larger scale in the future.

### How it works?
In short, my market timing algorithm identifies future pivotal moments in the markets - those moments when the price action breaks the trend line, bottoms/tops, makes higher/lower high/low and so on - which can serve as entry/exit points.

## Predictions

### Long- and Mid-Term Investment Opportunities
By analyzing past pivotal moments on higher time scales and the market's subsequent behavior, it is possible to identify the current trend — bullish or bearish — dominating the market. This analysis can guide mid- and long-term investments. Here's the current market condition:

* US10Y - Bearish
* DXY - Bearish
* SPX - Neutral
* NGAS - Bullish
* XAUUSD - Bullish
* BTCUSD - Bearish
* RUBUSD - Bearish
* EURUSD - Bullish
* CNYUSD - Bullish
* GBPUSD - Bullish

It should be noted that the trend of the market might change any time - ranging from a few months to several years.
The market trends mentioned here reflect the current analysis (as of 21.08.2024) and need to be reassessed periodically to adapt to market shifts, so I might update the market condition after a few months if trend change is detected in any of the above-mentioned markets.

### Short-Term Trading opportunities

The predicted pivotal moments listed below can be used to do short-term trading, supplemented by additional basic technical analysis.

* US10Y - 12 Sep, 17 Oct
* DXY - 24 Sep, 30 Oct
* SPX - 23 Aug, 16 Oct
* NGAS - 6 Sep, 2 Oct
* CRUDE OIL - 4 Sep, 23 Sep, 28 Oct
* XAUUSD - 26 Sep
* BTCUSD  - 19 Sep, 1 Oct, 20 Oct
* RUBUSD - 4 Oct
* EURUSD - 27 Aug, 12 Sep
* CNYUSD - 11 Sep
* GBPUSD - 24 Sep, 8 Oct

For now (as of 21.08.2024) I am only giving the pivotal moments until the November of 2024. I will be adding more soon.


## EDIT (18.09.2024):

As I've said before markets need to be reassessed periodically. Taking into account the recent changes in the markets, I did the following changes:

### Long- and Mid-Term Investment Opportunities
* SXP - Neutral (I am changing from Bullish to Neutral position for now. I will pick a side later in November)
* OIL - Bearish (I wasn't sure about the direction of the oil when I did this post, now it is more clear to me)

### Short-Term Trading opportunities
My pivot points for short term trading opportunities remain unchanged. I am adding the following dates though:

* BTCUSD: 1 Oct
* GBPUSD: 24 Sep


Happy Investing!
